The Fryst PCMs are chilling molecules that provide a cooling sensation by transforming from a solid to liquid state when heated by the body. Celliant is a unique fiber that utilizes natural minerals to transform your body’s heat into waves of energy. The energy is then reflected back to you through the medium of fibers, helping to enhance faster recovery and promote quality of sleep.\nLearn More\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nHow would you rate the firmness of the Bear Elite Hybrid Mattress?\n\nWe rate the Firm at 7, the Medium at 6, and the Soft at 5. If you are torn between which feel is best for you, we recommend Medium. With over 80% of sleepers preferring a mattress with a firmness rating between 5.5 and 7.5, the Medium falls right in that sweet spot.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between the Bear Elite Hybrid and Bear Hybrid Mattress?\n\nThe Elite Hybrid utilizes a Phase Change Material (PCM) that is cool to the touch and advanced zoned-coils for added pressure point relief from head to toe. The Elite Hybrid also offers you an extra inch of cooling comfort and three different firmness-levels to choose between for the ultimate in mattress luxury. Both the Elite Hybrid and Hybrid mattress have Sleep Recovery Technology™ powered by Celliant™ for faster recovery and natural Copper for a cleaner night’s sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I customize the firmness of the Bear Elite Hybrid Mattress?\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot offer individual firmness customization on the mattress. Luckily, it comes in three different comfort levels - Soft (plushest feel), Medium (most popular), and Firm (best for heavier sleepers) — so we have no doubt you will find one that suits you perfectly.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the Bear Elite Hybrid made in the USA?\n\nWe are proud that all Elite Hybrid mattresses are made in the USA using foreign and domestic components. By owning the factory we’re able to control product quality to meet the highest standards, offer competitive prices, and ship them directly to our customers.\n\n\n\n\nView More FAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter Sleep to Boost Recovery\n\n\n\n\n\nYES, INCLUDE IT\nCLOSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Pricing Details\n\nWe strive to bring you the lowest prices.

We would categorize the mattress as a medium-firm. With over 10,000 verified customer reviews, our customers give the Bear Original a firmness rating of 7.1 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most firm.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat sets the Bear Original apart from other mattresses?\n\nThe Bear Original was engineered using multiple layers of cooling, contouring, and comforting memory foam to increase the pressure relieving properties that help you sleep better and recover faster. We also go beyond traditional foams and use cooling-gel memory foam in the comfort layer and our own responsive transition foam to keep your body cool and spine aligned. Choose the Celliant infused cover to get Celliant® technology woven in to promote cooling and recovery. Celliant is a unique fiber that utilizes natural minerals to reflect your body’s natural energy back as light. We worked with experts around the world to design a mattress that is universally comfortable, sleeps cool, helps you recover faster and increases your energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the Bear Original have a break-in period?\n\nNo, the mattress is great from the start! It will probably take you some time to adjust to the feel so we ask you to sleep on the Bear Original for at least 30 nights before you decide to keep or return it.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the Bear Original smell?\n\nBear uses foams that have little to no smell. If anything, it would be very slight when you first unpack the mattress, like a new pair of sneakers, and then will dissipate within a couple days.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat type of base do I need for the Bear Original mattress?\n\nOur bed is designed to lay on any hard, flat surface. We highly recommend the Bear Foundation paired with a bed frame. Other options include a platform bed, adjustable base, or the floor. We don't recommend using a traditional coil box spring, because it does not provide an evenly distributed surface area for foam-based mattresses.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between All Foam and Hybrid?\n\nMemory foam, unlike a traditional spring mattress, offers the sensation of contouring your body — a kind of shock absorption for your back that keeps you comfortable throughout the night. With a hybrid, you’ve still got the feeling of a mattress hugging you to sleep, but you also have a… more romantic innerspring bounce. In general, hybrid mattresses tend to have more options when it comes to firmness than memory foam.\n\n\n\n\nView More FAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter Sleep to Boost Recovery\n\n\n\n\n\nYES, INCLUDE IT\nCLOSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Pricing Details\n\nWe strive to bring you the lowest prices.

Soft or firm?\n\nThe Bear Natural mattress was designed with a medium-firm feel.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the Bear Natural mattress work with adjustable bases?\n\nYes! The Bear Natural should work with any adjustable base.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo Bear Natural mattresses contain fiberglass?\n\nNo, every Bear Natural mattress is made without the use of fiberglass. Bear Natural mattresses are designed with a fire safe and fiberglass free solution, instead of spraying on fire retardant chemical sprays, we ensure all Bear mattresses are made with fire resistant fabric quilted into the mattress panels. The fabric used is made from a blend of non-woven hydrated silica, rayon, polyester, and cotton. Read more in our Fiberglass-Free Mattresses: A Deep Dive\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m allergic to latex. Is that a problem?\n\nThe majority of latex allergies are due to direct contact or inhalation of airborne latex particles. All of the latex used in the Bear Natural mattress is encased. Although skin-to-latex does not occur during normal use, we suggest you consult your allergist prior to purchase if you are uncertain.\n\n\n\n\nView More FAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Pricing Details\n\nWe strive to bring you the lowest prices.

Plus a comfort layer of gel infused foam for cooling comfort. We would categorize the mattress as a medium-firm. We give the Pro Hybrid a firmness rating of 7.0 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most firm.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the Pro Hybrid smell?\n\nBear uses foams that have little to no smell. If anything, it would be very slight when you first unpack the mattress, like a new pair of sneakers, and then will dissipate within a couple days.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should I rest the Pro Hybrid on?\n\nOur bed is designed to lay on any hard, flat surface. We highly recommend the Bear Foundation paired with a bed frame. Other options include a platform bed, adjustable base, or the floor. We don't recommend using a traditional coil box spring, because it does not provide an evenly distributed surface area for foam-based mattresses.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between All Foam and Hybrid?\n\nAn all-foam mattress gives your body a unique level of support, aiding in spinal alignment and hugging your body no matter your favorite sleep position. Plus, this is the best option if you or your partner need shock absorption to reduce motion transfer.\n\nA hybrid mattress uses innerspring coils, so you’re getting that tried-and-true support, deeper compression, and classic responsive bounce of a traditional mattress. The top layers of memory foam offer comfort, spinal-alignment, and reduced motion transfer.\n\n\n\n\nView More FAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Pricing Details\n\nWe strive to bring you the lowest prices.

Honestly: great decision. I'm sleeping a ton better. There was an adjustment period going from a foam mattress to one with springs again, and it was worth it. Your sleep is an important investment.

Overall, it is rated as a medium-firm mattress, and on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being most firm, Bear Hybrid is categorized as a 6.8.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between a Star Hybrid and other mattresses?\n\nThe Star Hybrid is a premium mattress combining both coils and foams to create a 13” sleep system that provides a luxury feel, like your favorite hotel bed, that helps you recover faster and sleep better. The Star Hybrid uses Celliant® technology woven into the cover, as well as high air-flow layers to help you sleep cool. The difference is the Star Hybrid uses Serene Gel Foam and has individually wrapped pocketed coils for edge-to-edge support and a hand-tufted quilted top to give you a cloud-like mattress feel.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat type of sleeper will enjoy the Star Hybrid?\n\nThe best part of the Star Hybrid mattress is how universal the feel is. Whether you’re a back sleeper or combination sleeper, the Star Hybrid’s reviewers say it's both soft and supportive at the same time. How is that even possible you ask? We can explain, it has a cover quilted with foam, plus 2 more layers of foam. The foam layers are made with gel and copper, plus Celliant® fibers woven into the cover making it engineered to keep the bed cool. To finish off the bed is a thick supportive coil system at the base of the mattress. Even though it has soft foam layers up top, it still offers great support because of its strong coils system so you get benefits of a cushion surface without sacrificing support. We highly recommend the Star Hybrid for side sleepers, combination sleepers (side and back sleepers), and couples of various sizes and sleep positions. The foam layers will cushion your shoulders and hips and prevent painful pressure from building up overnight. It's supportive enough to support the midsection which can sometimes dip if the mattress is too soft. Finally, it's an excellent pick for sleepers who tend to sleep hot.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the Star Hybrid made in the USA?\n\nThe Star Hybrid is made in the USA using foreign and domestic components. It is built with CertiPur-US Certified foams and is GREENGUARD Gold Certified, because your bedroom’s air quality is just as important as your sleep quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView More FAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Pricing Details\n\nWe strive to bring you the lowest prices.

It is built with a solid core using 6\" of individually wrapped coils for deep compression and durable support. In addition, the top layer is made of gel infused memory foam for cooling comfort. We would categorize the mattress to be a medium-firm, a 6.8 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most firm.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the Bear Cub - Kids Mattress smell?\n\nThe Bear Cub mattress uses foams that have little to no smell. If anything, it would be very slight when you first unpack the mattress, similar to a fresh pair of sneakers. Any sort of smell shall dissipate within a couple days.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between All Foam and Hybrid?\n\nMemory foam, unlike a traditional spring mattress, offers a contouring sensation for the sleeper — a kind of cuddly hug for a child’s growing body that keeps them comfortable throughout the night. A hybrid mattress offers a subtle comforting hug, plus an innerspring bounce which is the best for jumping on the bed (Shhh…don’t tell them Bear said that). In general, a hybrid mattress tends to have deeper compression and quicker response, which is perfect for a growing child.\n\n\n\n\nView More FAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Pricing Details\n\nWe strive to bring you the lowest prices.

Looking for some extra relief after a long day? The split king option lets you and your partner move independently from each-other. So you can both be in your ideal and most comfortable position.\n\n\n\nSleek & Innovative Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor versatility and convenience, the Adjustable flex bed is designed to seamlessly fit into most modern bed frames. Careful positioning of the motors and linkages ensures they do not disrupt the bed frame's supports or under-bed storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZero-G Preset raises the head and legs slightly above the heart to promote circulation and relieve lower back pressure.  This position helps evens out the pressure throughout your body – alleviating joints, neck muscles, upper back tension, and pressure on the hips and lower back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjustable beds have many everyday advantages in terms of quality of sleep, convenience, and overall comfort. Need more reasons on why an adjustable bed is right for you? Read our blog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nHow can an Adjustable Bed Base help improve my sleep quality?\n\nAn Adjustable bed base can provide relief and enhance your comfort in various situations, such as snoring, reading or watching TV, addressing chronic pain, accommodating different mattress types, and managing acid reflux. These beds offer a versatile solution to improve your sleep and overall well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Zero Gravity?\n\nZero Gravity refers to a neutral body posture that simulates weightlessness. Developed by NASA for astronauts during takeoff, Zero Gravity includes slightly raising both the head and foot of your bed for the most relaxed position possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can the Adjustable Flex Bed help with relieving back pain?\n\nThe Adjustable Flex Bed allows you to raise both your head and feet into a comfortable position that reduces stress, particularly near your lower back. With wireless remote control, you can customize your unique angle for optimal comfort.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow difficult are delivery and setup?\n\nThe Adjustable Flex Bed is shipped directly to your home via FedEx Ground and assembly is quick and easy. Your shipment will include easy-to-follow instructions. We recommend two or more people be present for assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the height of the Adjustable Flex Bed adjustable?\n\nYes, the Adjustable Flex Bed comes with four height-adjusting leg segments. Each leg segment is 3 inches. So you have the ability to adjust the clearance under the base to be 3, 6, 9 or 12 inches from the floor.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan my partner and I move independently of each other on the Adjustable Flex Bed\n\nYes. We offer a Split King setup, which is two Twin XL bases side-by-side. You and your partner can lay next to each other, but each sleep in your favorite position. These separate units can also be synced to move together. Additional instructions are included with the owner’s manual you’ll receive upon delivery.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the weight capacity of the Adjustable Flex Bed?\n\nThe strong yet light-weight aluminum frame can support 750 lbs, evenly distributed.\n\n\n\n\nView More FAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBear Adjustable Base Reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n      View Product Specs\r\n  \t\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Specs\n\n\nMeasurements & Dimensions\n\nPlease Note: Split King has a split design and ships in two boxes.

Looking for some extra relief after a long day? The split king option lets you and your partner move independently from each-other. So you can both be in your ideal and most comfortable position.\n\n\n\nSleek & Innovative Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor versatility and convenience, the Adjustable flex bed is designed to seamlessly fit into most modern bed frames. Careful positioning of the motors and linkages ensures they do not disrupt the bed frame's supports or under-bed storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZero-G Preset raises the head and legs slightly above the heart to promote circulation and relieve lower back pressure.  This position helps evens out the pressure throughout your body – alleviating joints, neck muscles, upper back tension, and pressure on the hips and lower back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjustable beds have many everyday advantages in terms of quality of sleep, convenience, and overall comfort. Need more reasons on why an adjustable bed is right for you? Read our blog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjustable Flex Bed Reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nWhat mattresses will work with the Adjustable Flex Bed?\n\nAll Bear Mattresses are compatible with the Adjustable Flex Bed. You can also use your current mattress, although we highly advise against a waterbed. If you have any questions about your current mattress working on the Adjustable Flex Bed, email our friendly support team or call 844-311-0035.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan my partner and I move independently of each other on the Adjustable Flex Bed\n\nYes. We offer a Split King setup, which is two Twin XL bases side-by-side. You and your partner can lay next to each other, but each sleep in your favorite position. These separate units can also be synced to move together. Additional instructions are included with the owner’s manual you’ll receive upon delivery.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the weight capacity of the Adjustable Flex Bed?\n\nThe strong yet light-weight aluminum frame can support 750 lbs, evenly distributed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the height of the Adjustable Flex Bed adjustable?\n\nYes, up to 12 inches.\n\n\n\n\nView More FAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n      View Product Specs\r\n  \t\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Specs\n\n\nMeasurements & Dimensions\n\n\n  Queen \n 59.5” x 79.5” x 3”\n 111 lbs \n\n\n  King \n 75.5” x 79.5” x 3”\n 141 lbs \n\n\n  Split King \n 75.5” x 79.5” x 3” (12 inch legs)\n 172 Ibs \n\n\n  Full \n 54\" x 75\" x 3\" (12 inch legs)\n 100 lbs \n\n\n  Twin XL \n 37.5” x 79.5” x 3” (12 inch legs)\n 86 Ibs \n\n\nMaterials & Assembly\n\nCan support 750lbs, evenly distributed\nMade in Vietnam\n\nWarranty\n\r\n                \r\n\r\n                10 year limited warranty.

Weighted blankets offer a hug-like sensation that translates into deep touch pressure (DTP) therapy. This form of therapy has been shown to lower cortisol levels (the stress hormone) and increase serotonin levels (the feel-good hormone)—as well as increase melatonin (the sleepy hormone).\n\n\n\n\n\nCan everyone in my family use this blanket?\n\nWe don't not recommend use of this blanket for pregnant women and children under 3 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of a weighted blanket?\n\nWeighted blankets provide numerous benefits, including deeper sleep, reduced symptoms of fibromyalgia, treatment for sensory overload—and much more! There is even evidence that these blankets can alleviate PTSD-related sleep distributions.\n\n\n\n\nView More FAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Pricing Details\n\nWe strive to bring you the lowest prices.

Read more about Mattress Firmness here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nWhat is a mattress topper used for?\n\nOur mattress topper adds an extra layer of cushioning and support to any mattress, making it feel softer and more comfortable. So, if your current mattress is too firm for your liking, adding a topper is the way to go.\nHowever, if your mattress shows signs of wear-and-tear such as sagging, a topper will not fix the problem. Instead, consider investing in a new mattress that can last you for years to come. See our mattresses.\n        \n\n\n\n\nShould I buy a topper to go with my Bear Mattress?\n\nWe don’t think you need to buy both right away. Most customers think their Bear mattress feels just right. Your body may need a bit of time to adjust to the feeling of the new mattress. We suggest sleeping on your new mattress for 30 nights. Check out our firmness guide for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I clean my mattress topper?\n\nThe cover’s zipper enclosure allows for removal and laundering for a cleaner, more hypoallergenic sleep experience. Read more about how you can give it a proper cleaning.\n\n\n\n\n\nWill the mattress topper make me hot?\n\nNope. Our Pro Topper is made with memory foam. A premium circular knit cover combines silky smoothness with exceptional breathability to deliver cooling benefits on contact. So, you’ll stay cool as a cucumber at night.\n\n\n\n\nView More FAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant To Safeguard Your Investment?\nSee Mattress Protector\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n      View Product Specs\r\n  \t\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Specs\n\n\nDimensions\n\nW x L x H\n\n  Queen \n 60\" x 80\" x 3\"\n\n\n  King \n 76\" x 80\" x 3\"\n\n\n  Cal King \n 72\" x 84\" x 3\"\n\n\n  Full \n 54\" x 75\" x 3\"\n\n\n  Twin \n 39\" x 75\" x 3\"\n\n\n  Twin XL \n 39\" x 80\" x 3\"\n\n\nMaterials & Certifications\n\nOur foams are CertiPUR-US® certified.

Our hypoallergenic GlacioTex fabric is made from fibers with high thermal conductivity that allow heat to be quickly and effectively pulled away from your body. Simply add this protector to your mattress and get ready for your coolest, most comfortable sleep yet.\n\n\n\n\n\nShould I buy a protector to go with my Bear Mattress?\n\nIf you’re worried about stains or spills and want to protect your mattress to extend its lifetime, definitely consider buying a protector. The GlacioTex Cooling protector is waterproof and protects against stains and liquid damage, as well as providing protection from dust mites, bacteria, and allergens. Although the protector is waterproof, it is still breathable and because of the fibers with high thermal conductivity, the cover will help you stay cooler.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I wash my GlacioTex Mattress Protector?\n\nYes! The GlacioTex Mattress Protector can be machine washed on a cool or warm cycle and tumble dried on low. Please avoid the use of bleach on this product.\nRead more about how you can give it a proper cleaning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I arrange my GlacioTex Mattress Protector with my sheets?\n\nWe recommend adding your GlacioTex Mattress Protector directly over the surface of your mattress and then adding your sheets and bedding on top. The skirted edges of the Mattress Protector will provide a snug fit to your mattress and hold it in place.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the protector work with Celliant?\n\nThe mattress protectors do not interfere with the efficacy of the Celliant fabric woven into our mattress covers. Designed for your active lifestyle, Bear offers mattress protectors that allow you to sleep cool and dry with our advanced technology that is specifically engineered to work with every Bear mattress.\n\n\n\n\nView More FAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Pricing Details\n\nWe strive to bring you the lowest prices.

The pillow has a specialty cooling fabric that does not respond well to a washing machine and dryer. You can remove the zippered cover around the pillow to better spot clean and allow it to air dry before reusing it.\n\n\n\n\n\nShould I use a pillow case with the Bear Pillow?\n\nYes! We definitely recommend using a pillow case to increase the longevity of the pillow.\n\n\n\n\nView More FAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Complete Bear Experience\n\n\n\nBEAR ELITE HYBRID\n\nOur premium innerspring + foam hybrid mattress.
